# Aviation Accidents Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data from 1948 to 2022 involving civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters. Descriptibe analysis of the aviation accidents data shows that accidents occurence vary across different models and that number of accidents vary across flight phases. The company can use this analysis to determine lowest risk aircraft best suited for purchase and ensure efficient business operations.
## Business Problem
The company is venturing into the aviation industry to diversify its portfolio, focusing on purchasing and operating airplanes for both commercial and private enterprises. The company, however, lacks knowledge about the potential risks associated with different aircraft types.This data analysis aims to tackle the primary objective which is to identify the lowest-risk aircraft that can be purchased by the company for the business operations. This analysis helps the company evaluate the aircraft best suited in terms of safety assuarance, operations reliablity and efficiency and cost and reputation management as it enters this new market.
## Data
The data source of this analysis is pulled from the National Transportation Safety Board that contains aviation accident data from 1948 to 2022  in the United States and international waters. Each accident event in the data has features giving details of each accident occurenece (e.g aircraft model, weather condition, event date e.t.c). 
## Methods
This project utilizes descriptive analysis. It provides an overview of the accident occurence to determine which aircrafts had the lowest risk and provided higher safety assurance.
